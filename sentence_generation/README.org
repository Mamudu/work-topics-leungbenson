Briefly describe the pros and cons of this method of sentence generationâ€“in what ways might this be useful as a student? A teacher? What are its shortcomings? 

Pros:
- As a student, who might struggle in ELA, but excel in STEM, having a formula like this might make generating sentences much easier.
- As a teacher, it is much easier to use as a guideline/checklist whenever students create sentences.  Feedback is much more objective in this case.

Cons:
- You lose the poeticness of the English language.  Sentences become very robotic and generic.
- This is based on the assumption that this is the only one true way to create sentences, but different cultures have different ways to create sentences.  What makes this way superior?!
